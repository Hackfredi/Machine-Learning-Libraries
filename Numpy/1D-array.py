# import the numpy you can use np instead of writing numpy
import numpy as np

#converting a list into array using numpy
l1=[1,12,123,1234]

#array is innbuilt data type to convert data type to array
arr=np.array(l1)

#type function tells the type of datatype used

#rhis functions tells us how many rows and columns are present in the array if it's 1-D array than it prints number of elements
arr.shape
